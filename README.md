EEE3088F Micro-Mouse PCB Assignment<br />
A Micro-Mouse is a maze solving robot. For this project we ave focused on the hardwareof the robot, namely the poer and sensing subsystems.<br />
The Power Subsystem:<br />
It needs to run the motors and charge a battery.<br />
It will need to fit onto the pin headers on the motherboard.<br />
It will need to be an appropriate size for the robot.<br />
The Sensing Subsystem:<br />
It needs to detect objects.<br />
It will need to fit onto the pin headers on the motherboard.<br />
It will need to be an appropriate size for the robot.<br />
The processor and motherboard have been designed for us.<br />
