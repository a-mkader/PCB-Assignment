# EEE3088F Micromouse PCB-Assignment

A microouse is, put very simply, a maze-solving robot. In this project, we will build a micromouse, focusing on the hardware of the robot, namely the power and sensing subsystems. <br /> <br />
The Power Subsystem: <br />
It needs to run the motors and charge a battery.<br />
It will need to fit onto the pin headers on the motherboard.<br />
It will need to be an appropriate size for the robot.<br />

The Sensing Subsystem:<br />
It needs to detect objects.<br />
It will need to fit onto the pin headers on the motherboard.<br />
It will need to be an appropriate size for the robot.<br />
<br />
The processor and motherboard have been designed for us.<br />
