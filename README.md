# EEE3088F Micromouse PCB-Assignment

A micromouse is, put very simply, a maze-solving robot. In this project, we will build a micromouse, focusing on the hardware of the robot, namely the power and sensing subsystems. <br /> <br />

## Motherboard Subsystem 
Fortunately, the motherboard subsystem has been designed for us. The motherboard houses the processor that will be the brain of the micromouse. <br />

## Power Subsystem
This subsystem will be required to drive the two motors of the micromouse, as well as be responsible for charging the battery that will supply the micromouse.
### <u>Requirements:</u>
It needs to run the motors and charge a battery.<br />
It will need to fit onto the pin headers on the motherboard.<br />
It will need to be an appropriate size for the robot.<br />

## Sensing Subsystem
It needs to detect objects.<br />
It will need to fit onto the pin headers on the motherboard.<br />
It will need to be an appropriate size for the robot.<br />
