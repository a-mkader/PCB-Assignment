EEE3088F Micro-Mouse PCB Assignment\n
A Micro-Mouse is a maze solving robot. For this project we ave focused on the hardwareof the robot, namely the poer and sensing subsystems.\n
The Power Subsystem:\n
It needs to run the motors and charge a battery.\n
It will need to fit onto the pin headers on the motherboard.\n
It will need to be an appropriate size for the robot.\n
The Sensing Subsystem:\n
It needs to detect objects.\n
It will need to fit onto the pin headers on the motherboard.\n
It will need to be an appropriate size for the robot.\n
The processor and motherboard have been designed for us.\n
